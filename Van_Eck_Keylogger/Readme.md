<h1>Van Eck Keylogger</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
Based on Tempest for Eliza , is a keylogger working on the principles of Van Eck Phreaking.

<h2>Van Eck Phreaking</h2>
Its a type of phreaking demonstrated by a scientist named Van Eck. In general , any trace on a PCB ,carrying high frequency signals leak a 
small portion of it as radiation this is primarily due to the current changing with time which sets up electromagnetic waves. Since the 
electromagnetic waves setup are as a consequence of the time varying current which in-turn is the control signal itself , this implies that 
there exists a correlation between the waves and the control signal and knowledge about one gives us the knowledge about the other. This forms
the fundamental basis for the working of Van Eck Phreaking.

<h2>Operation</h2>
The keylogger works by logging in all the keypresses and waits for the victim's PC to be idle for an aforesaid amount of time which indicates 
the absence of the user . Once the PC is found to be idle for this predefined time interval , the keylogger flashes a sequence of static with 
each frame corresponding to either a "dit" or a "dash" in accordance with Morse code . The keypresses are hence leaked through radiation using Morse code.
